# Folder Alias Manager

This plugin allows to define folder aliases. This is helpful in cases where the displayed name of a folder in Obsidian file explorer is supposed to change to something different than the real folder.

## How does it work?

The plugin is pretty self-explanatory.
You can pick folders in the left field with autocomplete helping you to pick any folder from your vault.

Already defined folder aliases are displayed on top

All defined folder will be sorted alphabetically

You can change defined folders or delete them

## Use case: Unified Vault Structure

### The situation

I have several vaults dedicated to certain types of activities and interests. Some of them have a little overlap because they share templates or archived notes, pdfs, etc.

### Challenge 1

When I started separating the vaults, I often had the problem of having to copy entire subfolder structures to a new vault which is a critical moment:
1. This can cause broken links in cases where the containing folders name is not identical
2. It can be tackled by copying the entire other vaults root folder and moving the rest manually inside Obsidian which then takes care of link updating
3. This is not just added work but also results in different note versions.

### Challenge 2

One solution could be to set up all folders identically with just numerical folder names like 1, 2, 3, etc.
This would - for me at least - make it more difficult to navigate my vaults since the object of separating content was to focus on different areas of interest. That means: folder 2 in one vault might be containing concept related content, whereas folder 2 in another vault is filled with workout routines.
So it does make a lot of sense to have names that 'speak' in file explorer.

### The solution

Seeting up an alias for a numerical folder name is the best solution. I can now drop things from folder 2 of one into folder 2 of another vault and also sync notes so changes will be reflexted in all instances. At the same time, I can give folders within Obsidian a name that tells me what's inside.

I have seen plugins that use aliases for folders and I know that it can be done with CSS. I was after someting slim, however, that allowed for quick setting and deleting of aliases. So I created this plugin. It helps me a lot with my workflow and I thought it might maybe help others.
